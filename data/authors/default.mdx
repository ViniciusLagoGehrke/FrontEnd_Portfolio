Father of two amazing human beings and married to an always inspiring woman.

Graduated in civil engineering, I am now a web developer with an interest in new technologies and maps.

I love biking, whether it's a 15 minute commute or long trips. I also enjoy board games, especially collaborative ones.

I enjoy to read/watch/discuss about various topics from Music Theory, Theology and Urban Planning to Afrofuturism, Cooking and Politics â˜­
