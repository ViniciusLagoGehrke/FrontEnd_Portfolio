summary: Learning a new language by practice!

As a Fullstack developer with over two years of experience in Kotlin/Java, PHP, and Node.js, I feel comfortable with backend development, especially using Node.js due to my frontend experience with TypeScript/JavaScript.
Now, I want to expand my skills by learning a new backend language.
Exploring Go will help me tackle challenges like scalability and performance while enhancing my ability to build more efficient and robust applications.

## What is Go(lang)?

Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source programming language created by Google.
It’s designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Go was developed with the idea of improving productivity in large-scale software development.
It combines the efficiency of statically typed languages like C or Java with the ease of dynamically typed languages like Python or JavaScript.

Go excels in building high-performance, scalable systems and is particularly popular for backend development, microservices, cloud computing, and distributed systems.

## Why Golang?

There are a few key reasons why I decided to learn Go:

- Simplicity: Go has a clean, minimalistic design. Its syntax is straightforward, making it easy to read and maintain, which is crucial for large projects.
- Performance: Go compiles to machine code, giving it excellent performance close to languages like C or C++. It also has a built-in garbage collector, allowing you to manage memory efficiently without manual intervention.
- Concurrency: One of Go’s standout features is its support for concurrency through goroutines. This makes Go ideal for building scalable systems that need to handle many tasks simultaneously.
- Community and Ecosystem: Go has a growing and vibrant community, with numerous libraries and tools that simplify the development process, especially for backend and infrastructure projects.

## What is Roadmap projects?

[Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) is a website with community-created roadmaps that guide anyone interested in learning various areas of tech.
Recently, they launched Projects, which offers different project ideas to help you learn by practicing.

## What's next?

My goal is to document my journey as I learn Go, publishing at least one post for each project I complete.
I’ll share my challenges, doubts, and discoveries along the way.
