summary: How did I containerize a Vite React application with Docker?
---

In a take-home tech challenge, I was asked to develop a webapp and one of the prerequisites was that they might not know which version of Node I was using.
My solution at that point was straighforward: I described the version in the README.md file. ðŸ˜…
Although that's not a bad answer, the interviewer was aiming at another point...

## CONTAINERS!

I already had some experience running database containers from Docker Hub, but had not yet done this for a front-end code. Is not big of a deal after all, so let's see how it works.

### First things first - Project Setup

Since this project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) we have to add some settings inside the *vite.config.js* file. You can skip this step if not using it.
The *react* and *tsconfigPaths* should be already there if is a React Typescript app.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tsconfigPaths()],
  server: {
    host: true,
    strictPort: true,
    port: 8000, // This is the port which we will use in docker
    watch: {
      // when using windows and hot reload doesn't work
      usePolling: true
    }
  }
})
```

Then add a *.dockerignore* file to the root of your project (next to *package.json*). This works similar to *.gitignore*, which will prevent docker from copying anything that is mentioned there. This is how it should be:

```
node_modules
```

Finally, create the dockerfile again on the root of your project.

```yaml
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /srv/app

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["/bin/sh"]
```

### Create a Docker Image

Now, open your terminal and type this command

```sh
docker build -t vite-image .
```

You can notice that we pass the flag `-t`, which stands for *tag* or the name of this image that we supply right after, in this case, *vite-image*.

### Create a container from this image

Finally, we can create the container with the RUN command

```sh
docker run -it --name vite_docker -p 8000:8000 --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/srv/app vite-image
```

The `-it` flags are used to keep STDIN open and to allocate a pseudo-tty respectvelly. This enables to access the terminal inside the container when it's running.
Next we name the container with `--name`, in this case *vite_docker*.

We also pass `-p` to set the ports as *host:app*. The first one is where the container will be opened and the second is for the application.

Followed by `--mount` that will associate the files on our project to the directory inside the container. This allows us to modify the code and see the results instantly.

### Install Dependencies and run the app

Upon completion, it will open the terminal inside the container and you can run your application with

```sh
yarn && yarn dev
```

You can access the output at http://localhost:8000/
Whenever you modify the code it will update in the browser. ðŸ¥³

### Last Notes

It is important to understand that this container ensures that all developers have the same environment on their computers and can run the application without installing any node_modules.
This container is not valid for production deployment.
