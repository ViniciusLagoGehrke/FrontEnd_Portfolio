## My personal Portfolio

This webpage is showcases my personal projects and works.
It was developed with React and Material UI and and automatically populated using the Github API.

Feel free to leave some sugestions, PR's or a star ;)

In order to use it you should add in each repository:

- A description on your repository.
- An image with this name _desktop-preview.jpg_ on the root.
- A website address (if valid).
- **A _keyWord_ on the Readme.md file (_OnPortfolio_ is the default).**

You can then deploy it on Vercel. Mine and you can find [here](https://front-end-portfolio.vercel.app/).
